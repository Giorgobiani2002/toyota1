        <h2> New Toyota RAV4 </h2>
        <pre id="text" >
            For the first time, the RAV4 will join a formidable team 
            of Toyota TRD Off-Road SUVs and pickups inspired by the brand’s 
            legendary off-road and desert racers. Beneath the new-generation RAV4’s
            bolder design, the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA-K) platform provides 
            an ideal base for TRD’s renowned go-anywhere capability and style. Building on 
            the 8.6-inch ground clearance and design features of the RAV4 Trail 
            grade, the 2020 RAV4 TRD Off-Road goes above and 
            beyond with suspension, wheels and tires engineered specifically for trail driving.

            its coupe-like lines creating a bold style that continues to stand out. Both the front and rear 
            have received detailed attention, bringing added refinement to the shape, while a colour-coordinated 
            lower lip reinforces a strong, wide and elevated stance.
            Front lights are upgraded to premium LED technology, with the daytime running lights and indicators combined 
            into one frontal projector that emits a single smooth line above the main beam. At the rear, the new combination 
            lights are connected by a gloss black spoiler creating a single clean shape.

            that the Detroit automaker wasn’t the best-selling

            top spot in America. Toyota was able to

            allowing it to take away GM’s throne 
            for the first time in 90 years. An ongoing shortage of
